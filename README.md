COVID-19 Tracker
We created this website to inform and educate people all around the world about the rising cases of COVID-19, Our website provides live COVID-19 cases from all around
the world with users being able to select the country they are curious with.

Firstly, the home page, the home page consist of a navigation bar with the navigation bar consisiting of five pages, home page, about page, details page, CovidTracker
page and a feedback page. Firstly the home page, the home page has a brief description of COVID-19 describing to users what COVID-19 is briefly, while having a button
that states "Read More" linking the button to our Details Page. We also have three cards at the bottom part of the page, that shows three different PNG formatted images, 
each explaning health related topics.

Secondly, the about us page, showing our Mission, Vision and Values. The about us page also consist of the same navigation bar. The page has three cards which was created by 
bootstrap, cauing animations to happen upon hovering. E.g. the image moving upwards when hovering.

Thirdly, details page, the details page has three animated cards displaying facts about COVID-19. How it spreads?, Symptoms of COVID-19, and Treatments for COVID-19.
We made it animated because it would make the user interaction more fun and interesting while learning facts about the pandemic. The cards will have a header for the topic and upon user hovering, it would move upwards and display more in depth of the topic.

Fourthly, the CovidTracker page, the page cosisist of our API that shows all of the case all around the world upon the user selecting the country. Once the country is 
selected, the data of the selected country will display, displaying the total confirmed cases, total deaths and the total recovered, it will then display a bar graph of
the number of confirmed cases, deaths and total recovered in a bar graph.

Fifthly, we have a feedback form for user to accept feedback. Each input has a validation.For testing, our contact form have validation.We have coded in javascript in a way that name must contain up to 5 characters, have coded for the subject feature in a way that it must have a input or the contact feature will not work. The code is also done in a way that the phone number input feature must have exactly 8 characters and the characters must be integers or else there will be a output saying "Please Enter valid Phone Number". Email input is also coded in a way so that user must input @ symbol and must have more than 6 characters for it to be valid. Messages were also coded in a way that they have to be more than 140 characters or else the input is invalid.Once all inputs are valid, a message will be displayed saying "Form Submitted Successfully!".

We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap and API. We used HTML for all of our pages as it is the base of out website, we used CSS to style our web pages, we used JavaScript for out Contact Page and our API page as for the contact page it helps validate each input as for the API for the CovidTracker, it helps to read the confirmed
cases, total death and Recovered.
